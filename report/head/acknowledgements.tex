\paragraph{}
First and foremost I would like to wholeheartedly thank Professor Stephan Morgenthaler, chair of Applied Statistics at EPFL for accepting to supervise my master thesis project.
\paragraph{}
I equally wish to express my most sincere thanks to Professor Joseph Gergaud head of the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science department at ENSEEIHT, my engineering school, for letting me extend my exchange at EPFL and pursue there the master thesis project.
\paragraph{}
My warmest thanks also go to Doctor Aurélie Hurault of ENSEEIHT and Mrs Coralie Link of EPFL. As my referees for all questions pertaining to my status as an exchange student, they always have been most helpful.
\paragraph{}
I also seize this opportunity to say how grateful I am to Doctor Olivier Lévêque of EPFL. I had him as teacher in Advanced Probabilities during the fall semester, and thanks to him I could stage a proper comeback to mathematics after three years of the more applied sort. When I needed to revise and explore more in depth Stochastic Calculus during the project, I decided to work on his course. Not only is the course excellent, concise and clear but Dr. Lévêque would always be available when I sent him a mail about the exercises I was doing to practice and wasn't sure about the result.
\paragraph{}
Finally, I would like to thank my family and my friends for their support !
