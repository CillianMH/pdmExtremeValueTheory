# pdmExtremeValueTheory
#### A repository for my Master Thesis Project at EPFL, Spring Semester 2015. The main topic is Extreme Value Theory (Statistics), with applications in Finance.
The project features an introduction to EVT (as it is a very vast field, six months is just enough to scratch the surface of it !). As the data used consists of stock prices, there is a strong Stochastic Calculus (incl. SDEs) component in the project.
#### Bibliography
* *Statistics of Extremes, Theory and Applications*, Beirlant, Goegebeur, Segers, Teugels
* *Modelling extremal events for Insurance and Finance*, Embrechts, Kluppelberg, Mikosch
* *An Introduction to Statistical Modelling of Extreme Values*, Stuart Coles, Springer
* *Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R*, Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson, CRC Press

#### My opinion on the sources
First and foremost, it must be said that __all those books are good books__ (I will focus on the books dealing with EVT, the book on R programming is a very fine one, with a nice hands-on approach). However, they are probably not meant for the same uses and the same users. I am giving my opinion on those books in case someone chances upon the repository and they want to learn more about EVT.
