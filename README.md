# pdmExtremeValueTheory
#### A repository for my Master Thesis Project at EPFL, Spring Semester 2015. The main topic is Extreme Value Theory (Statistics), with applications in Finance.
The project features an introduction to EVT (as it is a very vast field, six months is just enough to scratch the surface of it !). As the data used consists of stock prices, there is a strong Stochastic Calculus (incl. SDEs) component in the project.
#### Bibliography

#### My opinion on the sources
First and foremost, it must be said that __all those books are good books__ (I will focus on the books dealing with EVT, the book on R programming is a very fine one, with a nice hands-on approach). However, **_they may not be intended for the same uses and the same users_**. I am giving my opinion on those books in case someone chances upon the repository and they want to learn more about EVT. **_It is only my opinion, nothing more_**.
* *An Introduction to Statistical Modelling of Extreme Values*, by Stuart Coles (Springer) is not surprisingly an introductory book; most of the time, at best a sketch of the proof is given. It may be best used in conjunction with a traditional course given by a teacher that will go more in-depth themselves. I would not recommand it as a primary source for a master thesis project, however.
* *Statistics of Extremes, Theory and Applications*, by Beirlant, Goegebeur, Segers and Teugels (Wiley) is a balanced book, going enough into details. It is thus fit as a source for a master thesis project. The only thing going against it is the following : many figures to illustrate what is being explained is a good thing, but it would have been nice to detail a bit more the derivations of the proofs, at times. 
* *Modelling extremal events for Insurance and Finance*, by Embrechts, Kluppelberg and Mikosch (Springer) is nothing short of a summa. It is extremely detailed and thorough. I would not recommand it, however, as a source for a master thesis project as it would be a bit too ambitious to use it for that purpose. If you have more time and are ready for an involved reading, all the more so if you are interested in financial applications of EVT, search for a companion no further!
