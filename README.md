# pdmExtremeValueTheory
#### A repository for my Master Thesis Project at EPFL, Spring Semester 2015. The main topic is Extreme Value Theory (Statistics), with applications in Finance.
The project features an introduction to EVT (as it is a very vast field, six months is just enough to scratch the surface of it !). As the data used consists of stock prices, there is a strong Stochastic Calculus (incl. SDEs) component in the project.
